# BitTorrent Client

NodeJS based BitTorrent Client that is a custom written parser for the Bencoded files and the client itself.
The goal was to learn about networking and use as few external libraries as possible.

It can torrent a file from one peer as of right now, though I plan on expanding to multiple peers in the future.
